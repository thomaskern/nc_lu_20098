  abstract =     "Human vision can be used as a model for computer vision. We have conducted an experiment to investigate several properties of human vision that can be applied to, and that can improve computer vision. This report describes in detail the description of videos done by human subjects. Human descriptions of videos show the importance of higher levels of abstraction and that features of an object related to a task can raise the object's relevance.",
